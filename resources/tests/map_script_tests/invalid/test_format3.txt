// The game will try not to pick this map when the playercount is outside the range specified here.
// The BaseWeight of the map controls how likely the map is to be chosen in random selection.
// The map will not be chosen if the server playercount is below MinPlayers or above MaxPlayers
// The baseweight scales with how far the playercount is from the average of MinPlayers and MaxPlayers.
// because of this, maps with large ranges are not very likely to be picked at the edges of them.
// ResIntensity is a measure of how much data in unique assets a map has.
// It will avoid switching between maps with a combined intensity score of 10 or greater to avoid client crashes.
